# Ko-Lab

A real-time collaborative code editor with group workspaces, GitHub integration, and built-in team chat.

## Features

### Collaboration
- **Collaborative code editor** — multi-user real-time editing powered by WebSockets, with syntax highlighting for JavaScript, Python, Java, and HTML (CodeMirror 6)
- **Change request workflow** — members submit code changes, the group owner reviews and approves or rejects them; history is preserved
- **GitHub integration** — link any GitHub repo to a group; commits and file modifications sync back to GitHub via the Octokit REST API
- **SSH key management** — generate and register an SSH key from within the app to authorise pushes to GitHub

### Groups
- **Create a group** — attach a GitHub repo, name the group, and invite members by phone number
- **Group chat** — real-time messaging with emoji reactions, message status (sending / delivered / read), background themes, and browser push notifications
- **Member roles** — ADMIN (owner) and MEMBER; only the owner can add members and approve changes
- **Guest access** — time-limited guest sessions for read-only collaboration without an account

### Direct Messaging
- **One-to-one chat** — find a contact by phone number; messages delivered in real time via WebSocket with offline persistence
- **Read receipts** — single tick (sending), double tick (delivered), blue double tick (read)
- **New message divider** — visual separator for messages received while offline
- **Browser push notifications** — get notified of new messages even when the tab is in the background

### Social
- **Friends** — search users by phone number, add them as friends, and access their chat from the sidebar in one click
- **Friend search** — checks whether the current user has a phone number set; if not, prompts to add one before searching

### Profile & Settings
- **Profile page** — view and edit display name, phone number; email is read-only
- **Connected accounts** — see which providers (GitHub, Google) are linked; connect a missing one with a single click
- **Notification toggle** — enable or disable browser push notifications; requests permission on first enable; shows a warning when blocked by the browser

### UI / UX
- **Dark mode** — full light/dark theme toggle, persisted across sessions
- **Onboarding tours** — per-page guided tours (Shepherd.js) shown once on first visit; storageKey prevents repeat display
- **Searchable repo dropdown** — the GitHub group-creation page replaces the native `<select>` with a filterable dropdown with live search and clear button
- **Chat background themes** — six colour themes per chat (Default, Midnight, Sky, Sage, Rose, Sand), stored per conversation in `localStorage`
- **Responsive layout** — sidebar collapses on mobile; group chats redirect to a dedicated page on small screens

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database
- GitHub OAuth app ([create one](https://github.com/settings/developers))
- Google OAuth credentials ([create one](https://console.cloud.google.com/))

### Environment Variables

Create `apps/web/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/colab

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here

GITHUB_ID=your-github-oauth-app-id
GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-oauth-app-secret

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8080
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
```

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Push the database schema
cd apps/web && npx prisma db push

# Start all apps in development
npm run dev
```

The web app runs on `http://localhost:3000` and the WebSocket server on `ws://localhost:8080`.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deployment

The project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Set all environment variables listed above in the Vercel project settings. The WebSocket server (`apps/web-socket`) should be deployed separately (e.g. a Railway or Fly.io instance) and its public URL set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB_SOCKET_URL`.
